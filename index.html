                    <p>“The most dreaded bit of ocean on the globe – and rightly so,” Alfred Lansing wrote of explorer Ernest Shackleton’s 1916 voyage across it in a small lifeboat. It is, of course, the Drake Passage, connecting the southern tip of the South American continent with the northernmost point of the Antarctic Peninsula. </p>

For many, being able to boast of surviving the “Drake shake” is part of the attraction of going to the “white continent.” </p>

These “internal waves,” as he calls them, create vortices which bring colder water from the depths of the ocean higher up — important for the planet’s climate. </p>

                A dozen years after it broke ground, Vietnam’s largest city has unveiled its first mass rapid transit line.

                        Hundreds of people lined up for the chance to be among the first passengers to board Metro Line 1 as it began operations in Ho Chi Minh City on Sunday, according to state-run news agency Viet Nam News.

                        The line stretches from busy Ben Thanh market in the city center to the Soui Tien Theme Park outside its northwestern boundary, with 14 stops – three underground and 11 above.
                        
                        Its opening comes after years of delays, caused by factors including the Covid-19 pandemic and financial constraints, according to state media.

                    Srinagar, India DNBC — 
                    In Indian-administered Kashmir, long before the morning call to prayer reverberates across neighborhoods, the city of Srinagar’s kandurs, or bakers, have fired up their tandoor ovens.
                    Located in the snowy Himalayas, at the northern tip of India, this disputed region between India and Pakistan is a paradise of snowy glaciers, ice-blue lakes, fir-lined mountains, and gushing, stormy rivers. So famed is its beauty that Mogul Emperor Jehangir once remarked, “If there is a heaven on earth, it’s here, it’s here, it’s here.”

                    Turkey may be famous for its kebabs, but the popular dish is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Turkish cuisine.
                    Covering over 300,000 square miles, the European destination’s rich and diverse food is largely thanks to its landscape.
                    <strong>Ezogelin corba:</strong> An invigorating soup made of red lentils, tomato paste, grated fresh tomatoes, and onions.
                    <strong>Saksuka:</strong> A traditional Turkish side dish, saksuka consists of eggplant, zucchinis, garlic, tomatoes, and chili.
                    <strong>Kısır:</strong> This simple salad dish contains fine bulgur wheat, tomatoes, garlic, parsley, and mint.
