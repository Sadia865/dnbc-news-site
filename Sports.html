                    Court rejects Barcelona appeal for Olmo registration</h2>

                            <p>Barcelona's appeal for the precautionary registration of Dani Olmo for the rest of the season has been rejected, meaning the Spain international may not be able to play for the club from 1 January.</p>
                            <p>According to La Liga, the court rejected the precautionary registration of Olmo after "none of the conditions necessary for the adoption of the precautionary measure were met".

                                La Liga also defended the competence of its Delegate Commission to approve its budgeting rules, adding "this has never been questioned by any club, including Barcelona".
                                
                                The Spanish league said the decision not to register Olmo, who was a youth player at Barcelona but left for Dinamo Zagreb aged 16, was initially taken by its Budget Validation Body.
                                
                                It was then confirmed three times by its Financial Fair Play Committee, its Social Appeals Committee and by the Uefa Second Instance Licensing Committee of the Spanish Football Federation.
                                
                                Barcelona decided on the judicial route, but now face a race against time to find an alternative plan to register Olmo or he could become a free agent, with Premier League clubs reportedly interested.
                                
                                Spanish media reports say the club is planning to sell VIP boxes at its Camp Nou stadium which could bring in over 100 million euros, but it will need the approval of La Liga.</p>

                        <p>"Significant for us is what we felt at the City Ground, it's beautiful for us to go out in the city and enjoy this moment," said the head coach, when asked about their position in the table.
            
                            "The belief is here but the belief doesn't hide the reality. The reality says we haven't achieved nothing yet and we have two days to recover and rest and compete against Everton. This is the reality.
                            
                            "We believe we can compete as long as everybody understands every player in the squad is huge for us. We believe we can compete well.
                            
                            "The fans should enjoy. Let's enjoy this together."
                            
                            Nuno has put the club in a strong position going into January's transfer window, yet Forest are wary of upsetting the dynamic of a squad which has taken them so far this season, and keeping the team together may be more of a concern. </p>

                            The 23-year-old had been through so much.
                            
                            At 12, she had lost her father. At 14, she had left home, on the Caribbean island of St Lucia, to pursue her Olympic dream.</p>

                        <p>Alfred emerged as a genuine Olympic contender after going close to the world podium last year.

                            She won the Olympic 100m title at Paris 2024. In September, she had a St Lucia national holiday named after her.
                            
                            Yet months before she wrote history, Alfred's Olympic participation was in serious doubt.
                            
                            "Early this season, I had a breakdown. I told my coach I didn't want to continue my season, I told my agent to cancel my meets," Alfred told BBC Sport.
                            
                            "I didn't want to continue. I was so hard on myself. I was overweight, I was struggling mentally and feeling like I couldn't go on.
                            
                            "My coach took me off the track for a bit, we had a long conversation and we both cried on the phone.  </p>

                        <p>"The last thing he said to me was: 'Are you ready to be an Olympic champion?' He believed that I could be one."

                            Alfred is coached by Texas-based Edrick Floreal, who also trains Great Britain's Dina Asher-Smith and Ireland's Rhasidat Adeleke.
                            
                            His belief proved prophetic.
                            
                            In a frenzied Saturday night atmosphere at the Stade de France, Alfred seized her moment.
                            
                            With her first global outdoor title, she not only delivered the first Olympic gold in St Lucia's history but also the island nation's first Games medal of any colour.
                            
                            And she had achieved it in the Games' blue riband event, running the race of her life to beat world champion Sha'Carri Richardson in a national record time of 10.72 seconds.</p>

                            Alfred's passion for athletics was diminished by the loss of her father, Julian, who would take her to training and constantly tell friends about how fast his daughter was.
                            
                            "I felt like the person who wanted me to get to this point in my career was no longer here. I felt there was no need to continue," said Alfred.</p>
